Ouroboros (version 0.7)

Here is my chaotic proteomics project with a huge number of tools. I actually created  them myself, however,
I am pretty sure analogues can be found online. As such, they may not come in handy for you. Yet I decided to leave some instructions and reviews here  - you never know!

You need only one external module - PySimpleGUI. It based on tkinter, so you also may need to install it.

You can find that not all code commended, and sometimes code not commented at all. Commentaries about tools is at info_app file or in info windows in a graphical interface.
